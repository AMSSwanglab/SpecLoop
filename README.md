# SpecLoop
SpecLoop is a method for predicting cell type-specific chromatin loops via transcription factor cooperation.
# Motivation
Cell-type-Specific Chromatin Loops (CSCLs) coincide with different chromatin states, downstream gene regulation, and cell type-specific functions. However, the establishment mechanisms of CSCL remains unclear and experimentally measuring genome-wide CSCL is technically challenging, costly, and time-consuming. We notice that genome-wide transcriptomic and epigenomic data for various tissues and cell types are rapidly accumulated and publicly accessible in many databases, such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and Roadmap Epigenomic database. Therefore, developing computational approach to predict CSCL for the cell types of interest from the widely available multi-omics data is desirable.
